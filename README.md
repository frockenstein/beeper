# beeper

A coworker clued me in on Console.Beep() and once I saw that it took a frequency and duration
I immediately thought of making a console app that plays songs.

## Running beeper

Compile it and place a song file in the same dir as the .exe file. The app will take it 
from there.

## TODO

1. The tempo math is rudimentary and probably wrong.
2. Need to map up all notes - I just did enough to get the Jeopardy song working
3. Rests and other "feel" things should be included
